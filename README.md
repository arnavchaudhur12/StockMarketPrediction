Stock Price Prediction
This project predicts stock prices using machine learning with the Random Forest Regressor algorithm. It leverages historical stock data to make predictions.

Overview
The goal is to develop a predictive model for stock prices, providing insights into potential trends. The project focuses on using the Random Forest Regressor for accurate predictions.

Usage
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r Requirements.txt
Run the Project:

bash
Copy code
python stock_price_prediction.py
Data
The dataset includes historical stock data with features such as High-Low Percentage, Close-Open Percentage, Adjusted Close, and Volume.

Model
The Random Forest Regressor is employed to train the stock price prediction model using historical data.

Evaluation
The model's performance is assessed using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

Results
Visualizations showcase predicted stock prices alongside actual prices, providing a visual representation of the model's accuracy.
