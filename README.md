# Stock Price Prediction

**Overview**

This project predicts stock prices using machine learning with the Random Forest Regressor algorithm, leveraging historical stock data for accurate predictions.

**Goal**

Develop a predictive model for stock prices, offering insights into potential trends.

**Usage**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
    cd stock-price-prediction
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r Requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Project:**
    ```bash
    python stock_price_prediction.py
    ```

**Data**

The dataset includes historical stock data with features such as High-Low Percentage, Close-Open Percentage, Adjusted Close, and Volume.

**Model**

Utilizing the Random Forest Regressor to train the stock price prediction model using historical data.

**Evaluation**

Assessing the model's performance with metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. Achieves 95 percent accuracy**.

**Results**

Visualizations showcase predicted stock prices alongside actual prices, providing a visual representation of the model's accuracy.
